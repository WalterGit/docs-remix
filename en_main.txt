I'm just curious...
Start with the Technical Explanation. Remix is a new kind of web framework that we like to call "centerstack". It blends old and new web development models in a unique way that deserves some explanation!
I want to try it out...
Spend your first few minutes with Remix in the Tutorial. It introduces the core features as quickly as possible building a little contact management app. You'll see data loading, actions, form validation, search, redirects, and more.
I'm in, let's go.
The Discussions will help you get a deep understanding of Remix. Get yourself a drink and some snacks then dive deep into building better web apps with Remix.
I'm stuck!
