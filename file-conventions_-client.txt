.client modules
While uncommon, you may have a file or dependency that uses module side effects in the browser. You can use *.client.ts on file names or nest files within .client directories to force them out of server bundles.
// this would break the server
export const supportsVibrationAPI =
  "vibrate" in window.navigator;

Note that values exported from this module will all be undefined on the server, so the only places to use them are in useEffect and user events like click handlers.
import { supportsVibrationAPI } from "./feature-check.client.ts";

console.log(supportsVibrationAPI);
// server: undefined
// client: true | false

.client directories are only supported when using Remix Vite. The Classic Remix Compiler only supports .client files.
Refer to the Route Module section in the sidebar for more information.
