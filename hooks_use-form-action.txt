useFormAction
Resolves the URL to the closest route in the component hierarchy instead of the current URL of the app.
This is used internally by <Form> to resolve the action to the closest route, but can be used generically as well.
import { useFormAction } from "@remix-run/react";

function SomeComponent() {
  // closest route URL
  const action = useFormAction();

  // closest route URL + "destroy"
  const destroyAction = useFormAction("destroy");
}

Signature
useFormAction(action, options)

action
Optional. The action to append to the closest route URL.
options
The only option is { relative: "route" | "path"}.
