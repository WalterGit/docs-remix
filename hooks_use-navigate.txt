useNavigate
The useNavigate hook returns a function that lets you navigate programmatically in the browser in response to user interactions or effects.
import { useNavigate } from "@remix-run/react";

function SomeComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        navigate(-1);
      }}
    />
  );
}

It's often better to use redirect in actions and loaders than this hook, but it still has use cases.
Arguments
to: string
The most basic usage takes an href string:
navigate("/some/path");

Paths can be relative:
navigate("..");
navigate("../other/path");

Please see the Splat Paths section on the useResolvedPath docs for a note on the behavior of the future.v3_relativeSplatPath future flag for relative useNavigate() behavior within splat routes
to: Partial<Path>
You can also pass a Partial<Path> value:
navigate({
  pathname: "/some/path",
  search: "?query=string",
  hash: "#hash",
});

to: Number
Passing a number will tell the browser to go back or forward in the history stack:
navigate(-1); // go back
navigate(1); // go forward
navigate(-2); // go back two

Note that this may send you out of your application since the history stack of the browser isn't scoped to just your application.
options
The second argument is an options object:
navigate(".", {
  replace: true,
  relative: "path",
  state: { some: "state" },
});
