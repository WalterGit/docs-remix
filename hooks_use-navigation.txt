useNavigation
This hook provides information about a pending page navigation.
import { useNavigation } from "@remix-run/react";

function SomeComponent() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  // ...
}

Properties
navigation.formAction
The action of the form that was submitted, if any.
// set from either one of these
<Form action="/some/where" />;
submit(formData, { action: "/some/where" });

navigation.formMethod
The method of the form that was submitted, if any.
// set from either one of these
<Form method="get" />;
submit(formData, { method: "get" });

navigation.formData
Any DELETE, PATCH, POST, or PUT navigation that started from a <Form> or useSubmit will have your form's submission data attached to it. This is primarily useful to build "Optimistic UI" with the submission.formData FormData object.
For example:
// This form has the `email` field
<Form method="post" action="/signup">
  <input name="email" />
</Form>;

// So a navigation will have the field's value in `navigation.formData`
// while the navigation is pending.
navigation.formData.get("email");

In the case of a GET form submission, formData will be empty and the data will be reflected in navigation.location.search.
navigation.location
This tells you what the next location is going to be.
navigation.state
Normal navigations and GET form submissions transition through these states:
idle → loading → idle

Form submissions with POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE transition through these states:
idle → submitting → loading → idle
