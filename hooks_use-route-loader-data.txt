useRouteLoaderData
Returns the loader data for a given route by ID.
import { useRouteLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

function SomeComponent() {
  const { user } = useRouteLoaderData("root");
}

Remix creates the route IDs automatically. They are simply the path of the route file relative to the app folder without the extension.
