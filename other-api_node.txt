@remix-run/node
This package contains utilities and polyfills for Node.js.
Polyfills
Since Remix relies on browser APIs such as fetch that aren't natively & stably available yet in Node.js you may find that your unit tests fail without these globals when running with tools such as Jest.
Your testing framework should provide you with a hook or location to polyfill globals / mock out APIs; here you can add the following lines to install the globals that Remix relies on:
import { installGlobals } from "@remix-run/node";

// This installs globals such as "fetch", "Response", "Request" and "Headers".
installGlobals();

Version Support
Remix officially supports Active and Maintenance Node LTS versions at any given point in time. Dropped support for End of Life Node versions is done in a Remix Minor release.
