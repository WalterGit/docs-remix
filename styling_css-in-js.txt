CSS in JS libraries
You can use CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components and Emotion. Some of them require a "double render" in order to extract the styles from the component tree during the server render.
Since each library is integrated differently, check out our examples repo to see how to use some of the most popular CSS-in-JS libraries. If you've got a library working well that hasn't been covered, please contribute an example!
